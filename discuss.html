<h3>National Trends from Election Results</h3>
<p>From our preliminary analysis of the 2012â€“2016 election data, we
observed several key trends in the political landscape across U.S.
counties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Republican Dominance: More counties have the Republican Party as
the majority party compared to those with a Democratic majority.
Republican-leaning counties dominate the U.S. geography, particularly in
the Midwest and South. This trend is consistent with historical voting
patterns, where these regions have traditionally favored the Republican
Party.</p></li>
<li><p>Strong Republican Support: In addition to a larger number of
Republican-majority counties, there is a higher concentration of
counties with strong Republican support compared to Democratic counties,
which tend to be more evenly split or less firmly aligned with the
Democratic Party.</p></li>
<li><p>Shift Toward Republicanism: Comparing the 2012 and 2016 data, we
observed that the proportion of Democratic-leaning counties decreased.
This suggests a general shift towards the Republican Party across more
counties over the four-year period.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are regional factors that may explain these trends. The Midwest
and South have long been strongholds for the Republican Party. Changes
in economic conditions, cultural shifts, or issues like immigration and
healthcare may have further entrenched this political divide. Areas that
experienced economic hardship, such as the decline of manufacturing in
certain regions, might have shifted politically towards the Republican
Party due to its promises of job creation and protectionism.
Furthermore, there could be a broader realignment of voters based on
issues like race, education, and income, which have become more
pronounced in recent elections. These trends align with findings from
other studies that suggest a growing rural-urban divide, where rural
areas have increasingly supported Republicans, while urban areas have
leaned Democratic.</p>
</div>
<div id="health-metrics-and-election-results" class="section level3">
<h3>Health Metrics and Election Results</h3>
<p>We examined several key health metrics at the county level to explore
whether they correlate with political views. The health metrics analyzed
include the number of physicians, premature death rates, preventable
hospital stays, and flu vaccination rates. Initial analysis revealed no
definitive relationship between the health metrics (physicians,
premature death, preventable hospital stays, and flu vaccinations) and
the political outcomes across all counties. This suggests that these
health metrics alone do not directly predict political behavior at the
county level. A plot comparing premature death and preventable hospital
stays showed a positive relationship, meaning that counties with higher
rates of premature death also tended to have higher rates of preventable
hospital stays. This could indicate that areas with poor health outcomes
face systemic issues related to healthcare access or quality.</p>
<p>When examining health metrics by political party, we found that
counties with more physicians tended to lean Republican. This may seem
counterintuitive at first, but it could be explained by the fact that
counties with more physicians might also have wealthier populations,
which tend to lean Republican. Similarly, counties with higher rates of
premature death also tended to have a stronger Republican vote share.
This might be linked to regions facing economic hardship or healthcare
challenges, which may vote Republican in search of policies to address
these issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="regression-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
<p>To better understand the relationships between health metrics and
political preferences, we conducted a regression analysis using
covariates such as premature death, number of physicians, preventable
hospital stays, and flu vaccinations to predict the percentage of
Republican votes in each county.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Premature Death: For every 1 standard deviation increase in
premature deaths, the Republican vote share increased by 0.025% (p &lt;
0.005). Counties with higher premature death rates might face higher
levels of economic distress, which could drive voters to support the
Republican Party in hopes of economic recovery and healthcare
reforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of Physicians: For every 1 standard deviation increase in
the number of physicians, the Republican vote share increased by 0.078%
(p &lt; 0.005). Wealthier, more urban counties with better healthcare
access (i.e., more physicians) may lean Republican due to broader
political and socioeconomic factors in these areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Flu Vaccinations: Interestingly, for every 1 standard deviation
increase in flu vaccinations, the Republican vote share decreased by
0.016% (p &lt; 0.005). The negative correlation between flu vaccinations
and Republican vote share may reflect demographic differences, where
counties with higher vaccination rates could be more urban and
liberal-leaning, or it could reflect regional differences in attitudes
towards healthcare policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To assess the overall strength of the correlation, we calculated the
regression coefficients for the percentage of Republican votes in
counties. The overall U.S. dataset had an R-squared value of 0.125,
indicating significant variation in the data. This suggests that while
health metrics have some impact, they do not fully explain the variation
in voting behavior. When we stratified the data by election years (2012
and 2016), we found that the variations remained large, suggesting that
the relationship between health metrics and political views is not
constant over time. Focusing specifically on New York counties, we
observed a higher R-squared value of 0.387. This indicates that there is
less variation in the data for New York counties compared to the overall
U.S. dataset. This was expected, as New York has a more homogenous
population with fewer extreme rural-urban divides than the national
data, leading to a stronger correlation between health outcomes and
voting behavior.</p>
</div>
<div id="political-trends-in-new-york-from-2012-to-2016"
class="section level3">
<h3>Political trends in New York from 2012 to 2016</h3>
<p>Our analysis of political trends in New York from 2012 to 2016
revealed several key patterns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We found that more counties in New York had a Republican majority
compared to those with a Democratic majority. The majority of the
stateâ€™s geography leans Republican, particularly in suburban and rural
areas, while urban centers, especially New York City, remain solidly
Democratic.</p></li>
<li><p>There are more counties with strong Republican support compared
to Democratic counties, which tend to show more moderate or less
strongly-aligned voting patterns. This suggests a geographical divide
between strongly Republican and less strongly Democratic areas in New
York.</p></li>
<li><p>From 2012 to 2016, many counties in New York became more
Republican-leaning. However, the New York City metropolitan area
remained a stronghold for the Democratic Party, showing no significant
change in its political alignment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The trend of Republican-leaning counties outside New York City and
the strong Democratic support within the city can be attributed to the
urban-rural divide. Urban areas, like New York City, tend to vote
Democratic due to factors like higher diversity, younger populations,
and progressive policies. In contrast, rural areas have more
conservative views and lean toward the Republican Party, driven by
different economic priorities and social values.</p>
<p>Rural counties in New York, facing economic challenges such as the
decline of manufacturing and agricultural sectors, may be shifting
toward the Republican Party, which has focused on policies that promise
economic revival. New York City, however, remains more Democratic due to
its larger, more diverse population with a greater emphasis on social
services and progressive economic policies. The shift in New Yorkâ€™s
counties toward the Republican Party mirrors broader national trends
where rural areas have moved rightward while urban areas have become
more liberal. Similar patterns are seen in other studies, such as the
growing rural-urban divide that has been a defining feature of recent
U.S. elections.</p>
</div>
<div id="health-metrics-in-new-york-20122016" class="section level3">
<h3>Health Metrics in New York (2012â€“2016)</h3>
<p>Our analysis of health metrics in New York from 2012 to 2016 revealed
some interesting patterns across counties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>More counties in New York showed higher rates of premature deaths
and a higher number of physicians. These trends indicate that certain
regions of the state may be facing healthcare challenges or have greater
access to healthcare providers.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, we found that some counties had lower rates of
preventable hospital stays and flu vaccinations. This suggests that
while some counties may have a greater concentration of healthcare
professionals, they might still face barriers to accessing preventative
care, including vaccinations and avoidable hospitalizations</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Certain counties in upstate New York, particularly in rural areas,
have higher rates of premature deaths, which could be linked to factors
such as poor access to healthcare, economic hardship, and lifestyle
factors like smoking and diet. Counties with higher availability tend to
be wealthier or urbanized, such as in parts of Long Island and the
Hudson Valley. These areas may have more healthcare infrastructure, but
they also tend to vote Republican, suggesting a complex relationship
between healthcare access and political preferences. We observed that
some counties with high physician availability still had low rates of
preventable hospital stays, which may indicate good primary care access
or effective health interventions. Conversely, some counties had low flu
vaccination rates, possibly due to less health outreach or resistance to
vaccinations, which could vary depending on local attitudes or
healthcare policies. Rural areas or regions with less health education
may have lower vaccination rates, which can increase the risk of
preventable illnesses.</p>
