## Tentative Project Title

*Connecting Political Views and Health Metrics*

## Project Motivation

The motivation of this project is to understand how health metrics correlate to past presidential election results. This might uncover trends in whether populations with better health outcomes tend to vote in certain ways. Perhaps trends are more apparent in certain counties, which may suggest that while health outcomes do not *cause* political views, they do correlate with other factors, such as socioeconomic factors.
