## Tentative Project Title

*Connecting Political Views and Health Metrics*

## Project Motivation

The motivation of this project is to understand how health metrics
correlate to past presidential election results. This might uncover
trends in whether populations with better health outcomes tend to vote
in certain ways. Perhaps trends are more apparent in certain counties,
which may suggest that while health outcomes do not *cause* political
views, they do correlate with other factors, such as socioeconomic
factors.
